Coasting Tourism Vulnerabilities Model
The model below was built as part of the PhD study of Jillian Student.
This version was implemented in NetLogo 6.0.4.

To run the model, one needs an input data file.
The data file below was used for the experiments described in a paper submitted for publication.

### Abstract

This chapter introduces agent-based modelling (ABM), a useful approach for looking at complex interactions between humans and their environment, for application in the context of tourism. Tourism is such a complex industry involving many stakeholders like tourists, accommodation providers, tour operators, and travel agencies working together to create a single tourism experience. Moreover, tourism is both a global and local phenomenon: people who move from all corners of the globe are connected to different environmental and spatial contexts. ABM helps to improve the understanding of how individual interactions result in larger phenomena. Individual decisions, such as where to go on a vacation, collectively influence the state of the destination as well as local and global transportation flows, and these feedbacks are often nonlinear. At the same time, tourism and its ecosystem are changing through their interactions. Thus, ABM is a methodology that can improve one’s understanding of individuals, or agents, within a changing environment, along with the challenges that may emerge, and allows one to experiment with policy instruments and strategies to create alternative outcomes. Many forms of modelling focus on aggregates; however, ABM can capture heterogeneities in agent characteristics, types, and decisions as well as variations in the environmental context. As such, ABM has the potential to assist researchers in understanding complex tourism challenges, explore potential future scenarios, and support decision-making. In this chapter, tourism as a complex system and the relevance of ABM for studying such emerging challenges will be described. Moreover, in the practical demonstration, the main steps for developing an agent-based model will also be explained. To help provide context for the modelling steps, the model Coasting  will illustrate the process of model building, key components of the model, and analysis tools.
